# kmeans-clustering
Evaluating error of various k values for k-means clustering algorithm

This was a Data Mining project I completed in Fall 2018. It required the following:

1) Desigining an efficient euclidian distance function, as there were over 40 features to evaluate for each observation
2) Creating a k-means algorithm from scratch
3) Evaluating the Standard Square Error for the algorithm
4) Repeating this for k values 1-12
